# the probability of drawing an Ace from a poker deck:

    
# Sample Space
cards = 52

# Outcomes
aces = 4

# Divide possible outcomes by the sample set

# Ace Probability Percent Code

# Determine the probability of drawing a heart
hearts = 13

#Probability with Combinations and Permutations
# =============================================

# Permutations Code
import math
n = 4
k = 2

# Determine permutations and print result
Permutations = math.factorial(n) / math.factorial(k)
