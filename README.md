Since many struggle with the theoretical concepts of statistics and probability, how they make sense and how to actually use them in practice, this repo is a place where I will be sharing some useful python stuff around these topics!

Since I have made another repo, called "Random Python Stuff", I figured that this topic needs a specific attention, not to be mixed up with other "random" works and codes I shared.

So, here it is:

- Probability, practical aspects. Doing the basic calculations on python, and forgetting the pen & paper / white board ways.
- Statistical inference
- Hypothesis testing
- 
- 
 
 
 Most of the stuff here are notes I made for myself, materials I collected over the past few years, which I finally got the time to go through, organize and share here gradually.
 
 
 It was an accumulation of my "old stendent self" works, not polished at all, and this is the way I intend them to be. If you can't understand and implement a simple t-test, applied on a one-question, one-variable problem set, I don't see the point of doing that on a million row dataset, with complex algorithms.
 
 If you are a student, please feel free to drop a tweet if you really want to understand something here, I will do my best to reply and explain .
 My goal here is simply to give back.. I would never be the person I am today without the sharing and the indirect help I got from various generous people on the internet.

I will keep updating this repo with more materials, as I go through my old archives.
